AND DONT USE THE INDEX FILE IN THE UNNECESSARY PLACES - IN THE FOLDERS
<<
LIKE WHERE THERE IS ONLY EXPORTING
<<
AND DONT EVER REEXPORT
<<
ONLY---
USE IT IN THE LOCATION - FROM THE MAIN LOCATION - WHERE ITS BEEN WRITTEN...

AGAIN THIS IS NOT FOR ALL THE INDEX FIKLES

SEE PROFESSIONALLY
<

THINK FOR THE OPTIMIZATION
<<
SEE IF ANYTHING WE ARE REPEATING
<
SEE THE HOOKS, THE FORMS
<<
THE APICALL - ON BOTH SERVER, CLIENT
<
SIDES
<<
IF THOSE ARE PROFESSIONAL - IF WE CAN MAKE MORE PROFESSIONAL, MORE REUSABLE
<<
THEN THINK ON THAT
<<<
SEE THE HOOKS
<<
HOW WE CAN USE THEM MORE SPROFESSIONALLY
<<
MORE - REUSABLE
<<<<<<<<<

CONSTANTS SHOULD BE ON THE CONSTANTS FODER AND IN THE SEPERATE FIES -AS THEY ARE LISTED - INTO THE DIFFERENT FILES...
<<
SEE THE STRUCTURE...
<<
KEEP THAT STRUCTURE CONSTANT
<

<<
AND TRY TO MAKE EASIER TO READ CODE
<<
BUT IT SHOULD BE THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE - AND THE OPTIMIZED WAY
<<<<

THINK BETTER AND DO THE CHANGSE...
<<



NOW, we have to remove the logic- for the the session - location api
dont make api call to the - http://ip-api.com/json/?fields=query

its taking much time
<<
insead this, think for the better approach
<<
that wont use any external api - to be dependent on it...
    >>>> 
we have to make this very fast 
<<
so think accordingly ->>
for the fastest professional approach
